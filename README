iridium - Software project management

iridium is a project management application to coordinate
teams of programmers via a web service.

Requeriments:
    * django (>= 1.0)
    * pygments ( http://pygments.org/ )
    * pyvcs  ( http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/tree/master )
    
    
Setting Iridium Up
--------------------------------------------------------------

As with any other django app, you just syncdb and run 
(either via apache/wsgi or manage.py runserver).

In order to support file uploads (for documents and
issues) you need to create a folder in static called
upload, and a folder called thumbnail inside upload,
thus you would create the following layout:

static/upload
static/upload/thumbnail

By default Iridium will try to serve static, however
you may turn it off and serve it via apache or whatever 
you are using.

Once you have iridium up and running, log into admin
interface and add projects, everything else is managed
by iridium interfaces, altough repositories need to
be added via admin interface (for now).
